For this to work, open your windows registry. <br>
You can do this be holding the windows key and pressing 'R'. <br>
Write 'regedit' and press Enter. <br> <br>
Go to HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT -> * and right click 'shell' and press new key. <br>
Give it a name such as 'Move to'. Right click on that folder and press new key. Name this command. <br>
Double click on (Standard) and copy the url-path to where your MoveTo.exe is located. <br>
After 'MoveTo.exe', write "%1" with the citationmarks. <br>
The program should now appear on your context menu. <br> <b>
